# About this project #
This is a webcrawler with the goal of getting back html status and general info from websites.
This is progam that can take a domain name, for example "github.com" and give feedback if it is online, a scam website, if it redirects and more.
This program can take in a as many websites as you put in the excel file or you manually give a domain name in the file "App.java".

FYI: A web crawler is a program that searches through the web or on a specific webpage and fetches the html code (the code that structures the webpage).

# A little back story #
One of my friends was trying to finish a project for a company and struggling to solve some issues in his code.
As i was interested to learn more about jsoup and java i decided to do the same task and also help him with the code
as he also was still learning, this is the result of that.
